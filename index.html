    <h1>What is nice.lgbt?</h1>
    <p class="lh-copy measure">
      nice.lgbt is a project to enable people to host a website without having
      to pay for a domain or hosting through the use of
      <a class='link' href='http://pages.github.com'>GitHub pages</a>. Sites can
      be of static HTML content or be using
      <a class='link' href='http://jekyllrb.com'>Jekyll</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>How can I have my own site?</h1>
    <p class="lh-copy measure">
      It's fairly easy, but you will need some prerequisites:
      <ul>
        <li>A <a href="http://github.com" class="link">GitHub</a> account</li>
        <li>
          (optional) Have <a href="http://git-scm.com" class="link">Git</a>
          installed on your system
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy measure">
      Now you need to head over to the
      <a href="http://github.com/nicelgbt/requests" class="link">nicelgbt/requests</a>
      repo and open a new issue. This is further explained in the repo's readme.
      <br>
      After some time, a repository will be created for you. This is where your
      website will live. The content of this repo always reflects the current
      version of your website. In order to have your website go live, you must
      push to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.
      <br>
      Your website will normally live at <code>nice.lgbt/yourreponame</code>.
    </p>
    <h1>How can I get a custom subdomain?</h1>
    <p class="lh-copy measure">
      You can either include it in your initial issue on the requests repo or
      you can email me at <a href="mailto:fen@nice.lgbt" class="link">fen@nice.lgbt</a>.
      If you have a subdomain created for you, please follow
      <a href="http://github.com/nicelgbt/requests/blob/master/SUBDOMAINS.md" class="link">this guide</a>
      to set your website to be hosted on the subdomain.
    </p>
    <h1>How do I edit my website?</h1>
    <p class="lh-copy measure">
      There's two ways. If you know Git, good! Just clone your repository and
      edit it locally with a markdown or code editor, then push it when you're
      done! The changed should update instantly.
      <br>
      If you don't, that's fine! GitHub provides a web editor that lets you edit
      your files from the web! You can also upload files, just search for an
      "Upload Files" button.
    </p>
    <h1>Can I really include anything on my website?</h1>
    <p class="lh-copy measure">
      Well, almost anything. If we detect a
      <a href="http://github.com/nicelgbt/requests/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" class="link">Code of Conduct</a>
      violation within the content of your website, we will ask you to remove
      the offending content or, if this has happened before, take down your website.
