    <h2 class="pt5">What is nice.lgbt?</h2>
    <p class="lh-copy f5 measure">
      nice.lgbt is a project to enable people to host a website without having
      to pay for a domain or hosting through the use of
      <a href='http://pages.github.com' class="link dim dark-pink" title="GitHub pages">GitHub pages</a>.
      Sites can be of static HTML content or be using
      <a href='http://jekyllrb.com' class="link dim dark-pink" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="pt5">How can I have my own site?</h2>
    <p class="lh-copy f5 measure">
      It's fairly easy, but you will need some prerequisites:
      <ul>
        <li class="lh-copy f5 measure">A
          <a href="http://github.com" class="link dim dark-pink" title="GitHub">GitHub</a>
           account
        </li>
        <li class="lh-copy f5 measure">
          (optional) Have
          <a href="http://git-scm.com" class="link dim dark-pink" title="Git">Git</a>
          installed on your system
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy f5 measure">
      Now you need to head over to the
      <a href="http://github.com/nicelgbt/requests" class="link dim dark-pink" title="nicelgbt/requests">nicelgbt/requests</a>
      repo and open a new issue. This is further explained in the repo's readme.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy f5 measure">
      After some time, a repository will be created for you. This is where your
      website will live. The content of this repo always reflects the current
      version of your website. In order to have your website go live, you must
      push to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy f5 measure">
      Your website will normally live at <code>nice.lgbt/yourreponame</code>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="pt5">How can I get a custom subdomain?</h2>
    <p class="lh-copy f5 measure">
      You can either include it in your initial issue on the requests repo or
      you can email me at
      <a href="mailto:fen@nice.lgbt" class="link dim dark-pink" title="fen@nice.lgbt">fen@nice.lgbt</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy f5 measure">
      If you have a subdomain created for you, please follow
      <a href="http://github.com/nicelgbt/requests/blob/master/SUBDOMAINS.md" class="link dim dark-pink" title="Subdomains Guide">this guide</a>
      to set your website to be hosted on the subdomain.
    </p>
    <h2 class="pt5">How do I edit my website?</h2>
    <p class="lh-copy f5 measure">
      There's two ways. If you know Git, good! Just clone your repository and
      edit it locally with a markdown or code editor, then push it when you're
      done! The website should update instantly.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy f5 measure">
      If you don't, that's fine! GitHub provides a web editor that lets you edit
      your files from the web! You can also upload files, just search for an
      "Upload Files" button.
    </p>
    <h2 class="pt5">Can I really include anything on my website?</h2>
    <p class="lh-copy f5 measure">
      Well, almost anything. If we detect a
      <a href="http://github.com/nicelgbt/requests/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" class="link dim dark-pink" title="Code of Conduct">Code of Conduct</a>
      violation within the content of your website, we will ask you to remove
      the offending content or, if this has happened before, take down your website.
